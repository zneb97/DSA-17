# Graphs Homework 01

## `Digraph` and `UndirectedGraph` implementation

For this homework, we provide you with an implementation of a directed graph, as well as an undirected graph. You'll notice that `UndirectedGraph` extends `Digraph`. This is because you can think of an undirected graph as being a directed graph, where each edge is represented by two edges, one in each direction. Its functionality is the same as the one you implemented last homework.

## Problems

*Note: These problems don't **have** to be solved using a DFS. If you think of another method you prefer, feel free to use it!*

In `GraphProblems.java`:

Methods:
- `boolean connected(Graph g, int v, int u)` Returns whether there is a path from `v` to `u`.
- `List<Integer> topologicalOrder(Digraph g)` Returns the vertices in a graph, in topological order. If there is an edge pointing from `u` to `v`, then `u` comes before `v` in the topological ordering. You can assume the graph is acyclic.
- `boolean hasCycle(UndirectedGraph g)` Return whether an **undirected** graph has a cycle.

## Review Problem

Given an array of positive integers and a positive integer `desiredSum`, find the minimal length of a contiguous subarray of which the sum â‰¥ `desiredSum`. If there isn't one, return 0.
